![Weather App](./img/preview/WeatherApp.png)

**A simple weather application that provides up-to-date weather information for any location worldwide. This project was developed to solidify my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals before diving into React.**

## Project Overview

The Weather App utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data based on the provided location. The results are processed and displayed in a user-friendly manner on the page, allowing users to quickly access important weather information.

### Key Features

- **City Search**: Users can enter a city name to retrieve the current weather information.
- **Weather Information**: Displays essential details including:
  - Current weather condition
  - Temperature in Celsius
  - Humidity percentage
- **Weather Icons**: Intuitive icons representing current weather conditions, making the information more accessible.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be user-friendly across various devices.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the application.
- **CSS**: Handles the visual styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the application logic and handles interactions.
- **Axios**: Used for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Serves as the data source for weather information.

## How It Works

1. The user inputs a city name into the search box.
2. Upon clicking the "Send" button or pressing Enter, the application constructs a URL to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
3. The fetched data includes:
   - City name
   - Current temperature
   - Humidity
   - Weather description
4. The application updates the display with the retrieved information, including an appropriate weather icon based on the weather condition.
